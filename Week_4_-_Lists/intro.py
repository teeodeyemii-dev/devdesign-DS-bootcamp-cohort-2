# A list is a data type. Just like string, boolean, integer, and float.
# It is a container that holds multiple value in a single variable. Think of it like:
#  - A playlist with multiple 

# Lists are mutable. Because they can change form by modifying their structure - adding and removing items, sorting the order of items they hold

# Test scores
scores = [56, 90, 34, 75, 45, 89, 65, 45]

# Shopping list
shopping = ["rice", "milk", "bread", "eggs", "butter"]

# It's possible for list to hold values of mixed data types Although it isn't recommended.
mixed = ["John", 25, False, 3.14, ["Chris"]]

#  It's okay to define an empty list. Items can always be added later.
empty_list = []

# IndexError: list index out of range
# print(mixed[9])

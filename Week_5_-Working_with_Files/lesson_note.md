# File Handling - Working with Files

---

## Section 1: Introduction to File Handling

### Why File Handling in Data Science?

- **Data persistence** - Save results and analysis for later use
- **Data sources** - Most data comes from files (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- **Automation** - Process multiple files without manual intervention
- **Reporting** - Save outputs and visualizations to files
- **Logging** - Track program execution and errors

---

## Basic File Operations

- **Read**: Retrieve data from files
- **Write**: Create new files or overwrite existing files
- **Append**: Add data to existing files
- **Close**: Safely finish working with a file

## File Modes (Flags)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `'r'` | Read (default) - open for reading |
| `'w'` | Write - create new file or overwrite existing |
| `'a'` | Append - add to end of file |
| `'r+'` | Read and write |
| `'b'` | Binary mode (add to other modes, e.g., `'rb'`) |
| `'t'` | Text mode (default) |

## Opening and Closing Files

```python
# Traditional way
file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Open for reading
content = file.read()            # Read the entire file
file.close()                     # Always close files!

# Better way using context manager
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()        # File automatically closes after block
```

---

## Reading Files

```python
# Read entire file as a string
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Read line by line
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes newline characters

# Read all lines into a list
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(lines)  # List of strings, one per line
```

---

## Writing Files

```python
# Write a string to a file (creates or overwrites)
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")

# Write multiple lines at once
lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.writelines([line + '\n' for line in lines])
```

---

## Appending to Files

```python
# Add content to the end of an existing file
with open('log.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("New entry: " + str(datetime.now()) + "\n")

# If file doesn't exist, it will be created
with open('new_file.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("This file was just created!")
```

---

## File Paths

```python
# Relative path (relative to current working directory)
with open('data/students.txt', 'r') as file:
    # ...

# Absolute path (full path to the file resource, starting from your home directory)
with open('/home/user/data/students.txt', 'r') as file:
    # ...

# Windows paths (use raw strings to avoid escape issues)
with open(r'C:\Users\name\Documents\data.txt', 'r') as file:
    # ...
```

---

## Demo: Simple File Operations

```python
# Creating a new file with some content
with open('students.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Alice, 92\n")
    file.write("Bob, 85\n")
    file.write("Charlie, 78\n")

# Reading the file we just created
with open('students.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File contents:")
    print(content)

# Appending more data
with open('students.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.write("David, 95\n")
```
